# Drop Simulator Plugin
This drop simulator plugin allows for the simulation of any number of trials of most NPCs with a drop table. Uses the [osrsbox-api](https://api.osrsbox.com/index.html) to acquire an NPC's drops. Drops are then simulated and displayed in the plugin panel.

# Using the plugin
The plugin is pretty straightforward to use. Drops can be simulated either by right-clicking a monster and clicking the popup "simulate drops," or by searching a monster in the panel.
